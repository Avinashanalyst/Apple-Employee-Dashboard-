Project Overview
Data Collection

The project began with data collection regarding employee performance metrics, including project completion rates, training hours, employee satisfaction scores, and feedback from performance reviews. Integrity checks on the data ensured that the dataset was clean and ready for analysis.
Database Creation

SQL was used to create a database that well-organized the gathered data. Key tables were:
Employees: Basic information about employees.
PerformanceMetrics: Project completion and productivity metrics.
Training: Training hour records and modules completed.
Feedback: Staff satisfaction scores with feedback
Import Data to Power BI
Power BI is connected to the SQL database, and data from these tables imported for further analysis and visualization.
Data Modeling
Relationships have been established between tables (e.g., link PerformanceMetrics to Employees). Calculated fields and measures have been created in DAX, for example:
Average satisfaction scores.
Average completion rates per project.
Dashboard creation

The dashboard was designed to emphasize the KPIs for management insights. Key indicators used were:
Average Completion Rate for Projects
Total Tasks Completed
Average Training Hours
Employee Satisfaction Score
Data presentation used visual aids such as bar charts, line graphs, and cards that clearly support user engagement and understanding.
Interactive Features

To review further information, slicers and filters were introduced to view data according to department, role, or time. Further drill-down capabilities were added for gaining more details about an employee or a team of which he is a member.
Testing and Validation
The dashboard was thoroughly tested for accuracy and performance. All the insights were validated against actual performance data to ensure consistency and reliability.
Deployment

The final dashboard was published to Power BI Service, such that HR and the management could access it. The data refresh schedules were set so that the dashboard reflects the updated data.
Feedback and Iteration

The end-users' feedback translated to continuous improvement towards dashboard functionality and usability. Through this iterative process, the dashboard ensured the capability of meeting users' needs and providing actionable insights. Tools Used
Power BI Desktop: To design the data to import, model, and to develop a dashboard.
Power BI Service: Publish and share the created dashboard.
SQL Server: Simple database creation and managing
DAX: For calculated field and measures in Power BI
Outcome
The live dashboard provides HR and management with the exact performance metrics of employees, through which employee development decisions are taken and data-driven. This includes:
Identification of top performers and where to improve
Successful training programs and which ones to invest in more this year.
Identification of trend and possible problems lead to employee engagement and satisfaction.
General productivity is also boosted through a well-focused employee development policy.
Conclusion
Using SQL, Power BI, and DAX, I designed an interactive Employee Performance Dashboard for Apple. This becomes an important instrument for HR and management to track and upgrade employee performance. Data-driven insights serve a strategic approach to employee development, engagement, and productivity, which are all important elements in the context of Apple's growth and innovation culture.
